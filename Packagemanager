Package Managers differ based on packaging system but same packaging system may have more than one package manager.

For example, RPM has Yum and DNF package managers. For DEB, we have apt-get, aptitude command line based package managers.


YUM is the primary package management tool for installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating, and removing software packages. YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system or from .rpm packages. The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d.

It's easy to manage packages in Linux with YUM. At the command line, enter:

yum -option command

There are many options and commands available to use with YUM. 

Command				Purpose
yum install			Installs the specified packages
remove			Removes the specified packages
search			Searches package metadata for keywords
info			Lists description
update			Updates each package to the latest version

We can undo or redo certain transactions using the history command. Here is an example of undoing a transaction:

YUM provides many options for package management. For detailed option information, look at man yum and yum â€“help.
